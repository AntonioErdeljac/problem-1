# User Data Fetcher: A React Hook Exercise

## Overview
This project is designed to help you practice building a React component that fetches and displays data from an external API. It's a hands-on way to get comfortable with using hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`, managing asynchronous operations with `async/await`, and handling loading and error states in a React application.

## Objective
Your task is to create a `UserData` component that:
- Fetches user data from the following API endpoint: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1`
- Displays the user's name and email
- Properly handles loading and error states

## Requirements
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Implement the fetching of data within `useEffect` to ensure it's done when the component mounts.
- Use `async/await` for the fetch operation.
- Manage the state of the user data, loading status, and any potential errors with `useState`.
- Ensure your component is reusable and well-structured.
